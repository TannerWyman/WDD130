    <h2>Tanner Wyman</h2>
    <p>My profesional goal is to become a localizer of Japanese media, particularly video games. As you might have guessed from my 
        desiered profesion I love video games and Japanese things (though I can't speak Japanese currently) and hope to vist Japan in person
    one day.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints all of my life and am currently serving a service mission from
        my home. A favorite quote that I like from Brad Wilcoks is "A God who asks nothing of us is making nothing of us."</p>
