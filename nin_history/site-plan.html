        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        When people first visit the website the first page that they will be sent to they will be greeted with a short description of what the 
        site is and how it works. Just below that will be a vertical timeline for the release dates of various Nintendo Ips. Users will be able 
        to click on an image of the title screen of the games that will send them to a page with more information about that particular game 
        series. The reason for using a timeline is to make it easy to understand exactly when these franchises came out and the order that they 
        were released in. As some of these franchises come out in close proximity to each other there won’t be a lot of room on the timeline for 
        information so that is where other “series” page comes form. The most important information to make this site work is the original 
        release dates, how many games there are and what was the latest release, as some of these franchises have not had much momentum over the 
        last few decades. The biggest perk of this website over others is the timeline. Usually if you want to see if a game came out before 
        another you would have to look at multiple webpages to see well with this website you get it at a glance. The main visitors will be 
        people who have played some of Nintendo’s games on the switch and want to know just how old the series is or what other entries in the 
        series there are.

      <h3>Series</h3>
      <p>
        The other main page will be the “Series” page that contains information such as the release date in different regions of the world, 
        how many main line games there are, brief overview about the story and gameplay of each game and other facts. Along with the 
        descriptions there will also be a gallery with an image of the logo and box art or title screens of some of the titles in their 
        series. There will also be a mini timeline showing the release date of all the mainline games in each series just below the 
        discerption section. The reason for omitting spin off games is due to some series having a large number of spin off and side 
        game with there being little space on the mini timeline for that large of number. Due to the large volume of Nintendo’s Ips not all 
        of them will be represented, there will mostly be a focus on Nintendo’s major franchises and some of the more popular lesser franchises.

      <h3>Error</h3>
      <p>
        The general idea for this site is to help both the rising generation to know about the history and heritage of these Nintendo 
        franchises as well as older people who don’t have a deep understanding of Nintendo Ips. It’s not always easy to preserve the past 
        and websites like this help to keep history alive. A big gateway into Nintendo’s history is Super Smash Bros. As you play as many 
        iconic, and not so iconic, characters it is natural for people to be curious about them and to look for information. As there are 
        too many Ips in Super Smash bros I will only focus on the Nintendo franchises. Besides having information about major Ips like Mario, 
        Zelda, Pokémon, Kirby and Metroid there will also be lesser franchises like Star Fox, Mother, F-Zero, and pikmin.
