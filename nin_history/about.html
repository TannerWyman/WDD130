        <h1>Why Create NinHistory</h1>
        <img src="/wdd130/nin_history/styles/images/nintendo-logo-png-transparent.png" alt="Nintendo logo">
        <p>
            The reason for creating NinHitory his to help people be more aware of the history that these video games have. 
            Many people now days are unaware of the long history of Nintendoâ€™s video games franchises and are only aware of current games. 
            Thanks to games like Super Smash Bros Ultimate people can get a glimpse into all that Nintendo has done over the years but the 
            information is not very deep. There are also a number of franchises that have not had a modern release in a number of years 
            people and has been forgotten except by dedicated fans. I hope that with more people being aware of these old forgotten gems 
            that they will raise their voices and inform Nintendo that people still want these games and that they are not forgotten.
